            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE counſell giuen vs by the auncient, aduiſing each one (Right honorable,) to couet to be that he is, and no more: if it be well, and duly conſidered of, is not to be reiected: for that we be thereby taught two eſpeciall pointes, moſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie to be imbraced of all men. The firſte is, that there is nothing more decent, commendable, or yet more benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall to man, then to be contented, and conſtantly ſtande to his calling: without coueting, as ofte as his fond affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall egge him, to be other then he is, by chaunging of his manner of liuing. For that, as Numa Pompilius (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called to be King of Rome,) ſaid: There is no change more daungerous, and more to be eſchewed of euery wiſe and warie man, then the chaunging of his calling, or the manner of liuing, he is in. The ſeconde, and cheefeſt, is: that there is not one, who (beſide his apparant calling made by mans meanes) is not ſecretly by the vnſpeakable prouidence of God, called to ſome vocation: that is to ſay, to one maner of liuing, or other. And who hath not his particular diſtinct talent aſſigned him, to be employed to Gods glorie, &amp; the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon vtilitie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſocietie of al men? Which, as it ſhoulde appeare, hath beene the cauſe why that Philoſophers, ſeeing (as Seneca ſaith) that a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced nature, or inclination, ſeldome or neuer thriueth, or bringeth foorth good fruite: haue bene of aduice that chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, after they haue atteined vnto the yeres of diſcretion,
<pb facs="tcp:11050:3"/> and vnderſtanding, ſhould partely be permitted to the choice of the Facultie, Occupation, Art, Science, or Trade of life, they beſt like to followe: as that, wherein (in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie deede) for the moſte part, they thriue, and profite beſt. Suche be the ſecrete furtheraunces of God, for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie, eaſe, and releefe of his creatures. And, to ſpeake by experience, if a man doe well conſider their youthfull courſe, he ſhall not fayle to ſee children, almoſte euen from their cradle, and firſt vnderſtanding, giuen to like or miſlike, to chooſe or refuſe, &amp; alſo to be more apt to one thing then an other. Some giuen to a forme of Architec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: ſome to Letters, ſome to Armes, ſome to Sciences, and Mechanicall occupations: and ſo foorth.</p>
            <p>All, moſte apparent tokens, yea, euident ſignes, of this ſecrete vocation, ſurpaſſing the comprehenſion of man. So that this auncient counſell, is no whitte diſſenting in that point, from the aduice of the coeleſtiall Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher, and moſte bleſſed Apoſtle Saint Paule: who, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon this conſideration, willeth each one to walke worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and with all humilitie, meekeneſſe, and patience, chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably ſupporting eache other, in the vocation we be called vnto. For (ſayeth he) there be diſtributions of graces, and adminiſtrations: and alſo giftes, different, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like one an other, giuen vs according to grace: and diſtributed to eache one, after the meaſure of Chriſtes bleſſed will and pleaſure: to be by vs (following his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice) willingly, and with diligence, &amp; fidelitie, proſequu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, without being yrked or annoyed, or yet of our ſelues diſturned from perſeueraunce in the intentiue exerciſe therof, for any occaſion, whatſoeuer. Two moſt remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able leſſons, &amp; worthie to be remembred and ſpoken of, in theſe our dayes full of diſorder: when that no man (or at leaſt few or none,) is contented with his owne lott: but
<pb facs="tcp:11050:3"/> euerie one ledde with I knowe not what kinde of ſelfe loue, greedineſſe, and ambition, ſeeketh to be all in all, &amp; is not many times afraide (as if he had as many ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, as vaine thoughtes, or fonde motions,) like a blinde monſter to attempte things in deſpite of Minerua: that is, to vndertake things y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> be contrarie to his naturall inſtinct, and to caſt (though for the moſte parte, to his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion,) at that whiche paſſeth his reache, and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie. Without conſideration either of his talent, giuen him, not to be caſt aſide, or negligently digged vp in the Earth: but rather to be vſed carefully, and alſo liberally imployed to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon profite. Or yet caring for policie, the nource, and conſeruatrix of all well founded Common weales: as that which reſpecteth the Publique, &amp; all men in generall, and not any particular. Or once thinking on his duetie, whiche teacheth him, orderly attendance, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous perſeuerance, and humble obedience. Yea, or yet (whiche is the worſt) without remembring the feare of God: who hath created him a ſeelie member, of the huge and mightie bodie of humane ſocietie, &amp; appointed him his diſtinct charge, not to be exerciſed to his own particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, but to the reliefe, &amp; common maintenance of the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall bodie: neither more, nor leſſe, then as we ſee each member of mans bodie trauel in his degree, for the ſuſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and continuance of the whole. All, and euerie one of them, by Gods moſt wiſe prouidence, being ſo ſtreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſtrained within the limits of their duetie, that no one may, or can leaue his owne, to take to him his fellowes office, or charge: no more then one man (if he kepe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe within his boundes) may, or ought to incroch, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude him ſelfe into an others: but to the verie end (fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing their example, ſo neceſſarie for our inſtruction, propoſed vnto vs,) firmely to ſtand to his owne, without
<pb facs="tcp:11050:4"/> ſtarting, or of his own motion, once looking on anothers. A conſideration, thoughe of greate importance, in theſe dayes little thought on, and leſſe regarded. For, who euer ſawe ſo many diſcontented perſons: ſo many yrked with their owne degrees: ſo fewe contented with their owne calling: and ſuch a number deſirous, &amp; greedie of change, &amp; nouelties? Who euer heard tel of ſo many reformers, or rather deformers of eſtates, and Common weales: ſo many controllers of Princes, and their proceedinges: and ſo fewe imbracing obedience? Whiche beginneth nowe (the more pitie) to be lagged at the cartes taile. And to be ſhort: ſuch ſtraunge, and ſouden alteration in all eſtates? Doth not the vnlearned Layman, vndertake the office of a Miniſter? Doth not the Miniſter diſallowe of inferiour orders, and leuell (as a man would ſay) with both eyes at once, (for fayling,) at the Biſhops myter? Is the Biſhoppe, trowe ye, ſo exempt of ſelfe loue, and deſire of honour, as that he could not be contented to leaue his former vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to imbrace the ſupreme dignitie of Prieſthood? Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, the Plough man, doth he not thinke the Merchant happier then himſelfe? The Merchant, doth he not tickle at the title of a Gentleman? The Gentleman, doth he not ſhoot at the marke of Nobilitie? And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Noble man, hath he not his eye fixed vppon the glorie and greatneſſe of a Prince? What Prince could not be contented to be Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narche of the whole world? What ſhould I ſay? Would not the Lawyer (thinke ye) agreeably accept the title of a Lord? And thus of other: No one almoſte liuing not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected (witneſſe experience) with this peſtiferous canker of fonde ſelfe loue, impatient ambition, or yrkeſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentment of his eſtate: but for the moſte parte, all corrupted with the delight of daungerous change, and innouation. And what ſhould be the cauſe of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order?
<pb facs="tcp:11050:4"/> Forſooth, in my opinion, either the ignoring of vocation: I meane, that men doe not knowe, or conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der themſelues, to be but particular members of an vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall bodie: and that they, in that reſpect, be, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible ordinaunce of God, called &amp; appointed eche one in his degree, to ſome aſſured particular eſtate, &amp; honeſt maner of liuing, by his ſecrete prouidence: and not by happe, or fortune (as Philoſophers of olde time helde opinion) allotted vnto him, to keepe him ſelfe ſufficiently occupied (without needing to ſeeke any other, if he liſt, as he ought, conſtantly to perſeuere, and applie the ſame) in this life, in all vertue, to the common releefe (as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaide) of the vniuerſall Politique bodie and ſocietie of all men in generall. Or if they knewe this: becauſe the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and manners of men be ſo depraued, and corrupted, as that they neither force to obſerue this vocation, or feare to violate the ſame: but fare, as if euerie one were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined to liue, as a GOD vnto him ſelfe, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecte of the Publique: not caring, ſo their turnes be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, what become of the reſt. Wherfore, conſidering how neceſſarie the remembraunce of this vocation is, and wiſhing therewithall the impreſſion thereof in all mens heartes: as that, whiche is not onely the originall, and cheefe parte of humane ſocietie, but alſo the guide, &amp; ſure directer of all actions, and affaires, be they Publique or Priuate, Politique or Domeſticall: I haue taken vpon me to tranſlate out of the French, into our vulgare tongue, a Booke intituled, Politique diſcourſes: treating of vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the diuerſitie thereof in ſundrie kindes. By the which, as we be aſſured of the interiour, or ſecrete vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or manner of liuing each one is called vnto, (as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaid:) ſo we be alſo taught, how, and whiche way, eache one ought orderly, and duely, to enter into exteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
<pb facs="tcp:11050:5"/> or apparent Publike vocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, or trades of liuing: and haue alſo laide before our eyes, aſwell the dueties of them that haue power &amp; authoritie, to cal men to Publique vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations: as of them alſo, whiche ſeeke, or ſue to be called therevnto: and likewiſe, how eache one ought to behaue himſelfe, and conſtantly proceed in that he is called vnto: with diuers other points worthie of knowing, touching that ſubiect, (as I can learne,) not yet treated of by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: &amp; haue made bold to cauſe the ſame to be publiſhed vnder your Honors protection: hoping, though I haue in this my tranſlation, (as a young beginner) rather imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated mine Author verbatim, in his right ſenſe, and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: then ſought by poliſhed ſtyle to beautifie the ſame: that yet for all that, you will accompte no whit the leſſe thereof, but accept it in good parte, as preſented for a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of a hartie deſire to gratifie your Honor with any other agreeable ſeruice, whenſoeuer it ſhall pleaſe you to commaunde.

Alexander, Iulius Caeſar, and other excellent and greate perſonages, by what other meane haue they done ſo great and renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med thinges? So that it is moſte cleare (without need of greater teſtimonie in ſo apparent a thing) that there is no one thing after God ſo commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and profitable for the weale of life, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſocietie, as man himſelfe: euen as contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it is a thing no leſſe certeine and euident, that there is no euil, be the ſame neuer ſo great and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable, which chaunceth not vnto men by them ſelues &amp; by their own default.

But to what end will you ſay (Syr) tendeth this diſcourſe? It is, that therby I will inferre, that among all politike things, and which may apperteine to the gouernment, &amp; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Publike, there is nothing ſo reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendable as to vnderſtand what belongeth to vocation: that is to ſay, which is the way &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ner to liue, whervnto euery one is duly called, &amp; what is the duetie and office of them that haue authoritie to cal men. For without doubt, the firſt part of a Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weale wel inſtituted, conſiſteth in wel chooſing, picking out, &amp; ordeining of men apt and meete for the Publike choice, eche one according to the manner of liuing he is called vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: Neither more nor leſſe, then, as we ſee in the gouernment of a ſhippe, the firſt and moſt requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite part to be, that the Pilotes, Patrons, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernors be wel choſen and ordeined in the ſame. And euen as the good huſbandman reaping moſt commoditie of his tilth and labour is he, not that hath moſt land, but that can beſt chooſe and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the propertie and nature of ech plotte of his grounde: So the beſt gouernour and adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:11050:6"/> of the Publike is he, not that hath a greate extent, and moſt ſubiectes, but that can beſt han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle men, in well chooſing them apt &amp; meete, ech one for his office. This beeing moſt certeine, that ſome ſay, that The prince and lorde ought to husband his landes, lordſhips, and reuenues by men: but that he muſt husbande men by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. And if ſo be that Artificers and handicraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes men be blamed, becauſe they neglect the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiding of inſtrumentes, and tooles meete and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie for their Art and Science, and alſo for not knowing the names, vſage, goodneſſe, and place where to fetche them: howe muche more ſhall the Prince, Souereigne Lorde, and adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour of the Publique, be blame worthie, hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling thinges of ſo greate importance, and doing his actions, not with tooles without ſoules, but by the aide and ſeruice of men, if he be in that point ſlothfull and negligent? As there neuer was thing better ſaide, then this, that To vanquiſh and be vanquiſhed in warre, is but an accident of well or euill chooſing and ordeining of men: So ſay I, that the weale and woe happening to a realme, proceedeth no whence elſe, but of ignorance and negligence in the feate of vocation. And there is no greeuouſer ſickneſſe, or yet more daungerous to be feared in the body of a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weale (as in mans alſo,) then when as the members be ill diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and ordeined, it being impoſſible that they ſhould then do their office wel. For proofe herof, let vs behold all the ſeigniories &amp; kingdoms that euer were, &amp; we ſhal vndoutedly ſee, that as long as careful diligence in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wel chooſing &amp; ordering of men,

                  <hi>Plato,</hi> (to whome all antiquitie conſenteth and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gréeth) is of opinion, that man hath two good Angels deſtined by his planet, the one of his natiuitie and life, the other of his profeſſion, which we call vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: the which if it diſagrée with him: he thinketh can not be other then painful, and of ſmall profite. What ſo euer it be, we may well ynough ſay, that there be two ſortes of people which be very vnluckie, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate: the one of them be thoſe, which neyther make profeſſion of any honeſt office, nor yet do ought elſe that may profite, or auaile the commonaltie of men: the other be they, which make profeſſion of ſome charge, diſagréeing with their naturall inclination. Of which,<note place="margin">Two ſortes of people infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate.</note> the one may iuſtly be blamed of ſlouth and retchleſneſſe, yea, of rebellion againſt God and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, who calleth them to ſome honeſt office, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them to followe that which is appointed and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne in them: And the other be worthie of great compaſſion, bycauſe they be ſo infortunate and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouided of counſell, as that forſaking the guide of nature, they followe that wherevnto they be not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.<note place="margin">Prouerbs apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applyed to the interior vocation.</note> For the firſt, the auncient prouerbe hath bene made, which ſaith: that GOD is angrie with tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants or idle perſons: and fauourable to them that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:11050:12"/> applie them ſelues to ſome honeſt exerciſe. And for the ſecond, an other that ſaith: that a man ought not to enterpriſe or do ought in deſpite of <hi>Minerua:</hi> that is to ſay, againſt his naturall inſtinct:<note place="margin">A forced na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture neuer thriueth.</note> 
                  <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaying to this purpoſe, that of a forced nature or inclination, men reape ſmall profite. Which is the reaſon, as me ſéemeth, why <hi>Iupiter</hi> is ſo importunately prayed in the <hi>Pythagoricall</hi> verſes, to ſolace and eaſe men of the infinite toyles they daily liue in: or elſe to ſhewe them by ſome good Angel, the way they ought to kéep in their actions, during this life. As who ſhould ſay, that all the euill which is in mankinde, procéeded from no whence elſe, but of the confuſion and vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teintie of men in their vocation. But aboue al other, that ſecrete way,<note place="margin">The interior vocation is cheefly to be conſidered in publique vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.</note> by priuie teſtimonie of man him ſelfe, ought to haue place in them that be called to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny publique vocation, be the ſame Eccleſiaſticall, or Politique: that is to ſay, that men ſhould not ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly through auarice, or any other lewd gréedineſſe, accept any vocation offered vnto them,<note place="margin">Zeale toward the publique, ought to be in publique per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</note> but of a good zeale, to the edification, profite, and common vtilitie, ready patiently to beare all hatred, iniurie, and loſſe, for maintenaunce of trueth and iuſtice: And to be ſhort, that they moued with loue of the publique, and not with any particular, ſhould enter into publique charges. For, as <hi>Pelopidas</hi> going to the warres, aunſwered his wife,<note place="margin">Pelopidas ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his wife</note> recommending vnto him the care and ſafetie of his owne perſon, that it was to priuate ſouldiers that the ſame was to be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, and not to Capteines, which ought rather to be mindfull to ſaue other mens liues.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe is it not the part of ſuch perſons as enter into publique charges, to haue regarde to their owne particular, but onely to the publique. And beſide this ſecrete teſtimonie of good zeale and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, the other teſtimonie of ſufficiencie, or at

<q>
                     <l>First ought we learne by skilfull vſe,</l>
                     <l>What ylke ſoyle doth brooke or refuſe:</l>
                     <l>Corne in one place, elſewhere vines thriue,</l>
                     <l>Each thing hath place where best to liue:</l>
                     <l>High trees best fruits oft times foorth bring,</l>
                     <l>But in deepe dales, greene medowes ſpring.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>So it is vndoubtedly of the nature and propertie of wittes, inclinations, and ſufficiencies of men, each one in his degrée, chéefly to be vnderſtoode by them, which ought to make choice and election in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weale. For euen as there is no member or part of man, be the ſame neuer ſo ſmall or ſecrete, which
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:11050:22"/> hath not his vertue and ſeuerall propertie, greatly ſeruing to the conſeruation of the whole body: So is there no one witt, the which, ſo the ſame be well cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen and imployed, may not ſerue, and bring ſome fruite to the Common vtilitie. But to ſpeake true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſuch care and knowledge reſteth not in the heade of one alone, be he neuer ſo able: ſo great, and notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous is the weakneſſe of man.<note place="margin">Aduertiſment to them that vndertake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone the auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to call.</note> And they that enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe this charge and authoritie alone, ought to take good héede to that they doe, and not to be eaſie and light in prouiding, before they haue well and néerely inquired, and diligently conſidered thereof. For, ſith it is ſo, that one of the difficulteſt things to man, is to picke out, and chooſe ſome kinde of liuing, fit and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient for him ſelfe, yea, though he be ayded by the knowledge of his owne proper nature and inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:<note place="margin">Vocation to offices, is a dif<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ficil thing.</note> howe much more difficult a thing muſt it néedes be, alone to prouide for offices, men méete and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of the Common gouernement?

               <p>But to come particularly to Eccleſiaſticall and Ciuil vocations: men had ſuch care in olde time,<note place="margin">Diligence vſed in olde time in the vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call.</note> to perfourme that which belonged to the Eccleſiaſtical, that not contented with the politique election (wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we haue ſpoken,) they beſide that, declared and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed the name of him that was choſen, that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man might be receiued and hearde, that knewe ought worthy of blame and reproche by him.</p>

               <p>So that there neuer entered into mens heades a greater errour nor fonder opinion,<note place="margin">It is an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurditie to hope for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite, of the ſale of offices.</note> concerning poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique affaires, then to haue beléeued that the ſale of offices ſhould bring commoditie to a common weale: As if the principall force of a kingdome, depended on the almes or gathering of monie.

<pb facs="tcp:11050:24"/> but the obedient amitie of their ſubiectes.</p>
               <p>Oh, I would to God that we had hitherto had the force and vertue of men in more eſtimation,<note place="margin">The vertue of men more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dable, then that of monie.</note> then the force and vertue of monie: and then had we not ſéene the trouble and diſorder in all eſtates that we nowe ſée, the Publique eſtate and zeale being conuerted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to gaine and merchandize, not without great ſhame and diſhonour to them chéefly, that haue ſet the ſhop open to al men, making offices no leſſe common, then a harlot in the ſtues. So that it is a difficult thing in theſe dayes, to find one, vnto whome a man may not ſay,<note place="margin">Iulius Caeſars ſaying, to Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la.</note> as <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> ſayde merrily vnto <hi>Sylla,</hi> vaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in choler, that he would vſe againſt him the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie and power that his office gaue him: Thou haſt reaſon (ſaide he) to call that ſame thine owne of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, for it is thine in déede, ſith that thou haſt bought it.

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:11050:33"/> Which for al that come al to one point, which is, that his refuſall ought to be more founded vpon the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the common profite, then vpon his owne particular, wherein vndoubtedly a man may eaſily erre. And if we wil narrowly examine the fooliſh and vndiſcréete, ambitious, and extreme auarice of our time, we ſhal finde that the example of late hapned in the perſon of <hi>Mounſier de Moruillier,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mounſier de Moruillier.</note> biſhop of <hi>Orle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> is both monſtruous, miraculous, and alſo worthy of memorie: Bicauſe that after that he had bene cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to be of the kings priuie counſell, as one who had handled the affaires of Fraunce, both abroade and at home, in great reputation, knowne of all men to be of no leſſe experience then learning, good life and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation: being choſen to be Chancellour of France, which is the ſouereigne dignitie, yea, if a man might ſo cal it, the Solſtice of the honour of iuſtice, he would not accept the ſame. Wherein truly his great wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and integritie may not ſuffer him to be taxed, as hauing more reſpect to his owne particular, then to the publique, or elſe that any one ſhould ſay, that by ſo doing, he loued him ſelfe better then the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que, or yet reproch him of puſillanimitie: for he hath giuen ſufficient proofs of his magnanimitie, always accompanied with zeale and labour, employed for the Common weale. So that I can not impute the cauſe of the ſame his refuſal, but to one of theſe two points, or elſe peraduenture to them both at once: that is, to the time, (which I dare boldly affirme to be ſuch, as the like whereof hath not bene many yeres ſithence:) or elſe to the charge of his Eccleſiaſticall vocation, eſtéeming him ſelfe vnable to beare two ſo great bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens at once.

This vocation is no leſſe neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie and profitable, then the very elements by the which we breathe and liue. For beſide that, that by this vocation we be mainteined and conſerued in life as well as by thoſe elements, religion, peace, amitie, and the common ſocietie of men, is thereby the more conſerued among men. And without Magiſtrates, it ſhould not be poſſible that men could indure together without prompt and ſouden diſſipation and diſorder. Wherefore,<note place="margin">Obedience due to Autho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ritie.</note> euery man is admoniſhed to yeald him ſelfe obedient vnto the ſuperior powers, which be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined by God: the Magiſtrates them ſelues being called Gods. <hi>Plato</hi> ſayth after <hi>Horace,</hi>

For euen as (ſaith he, in an other place) ſhéepe, oxen, and kine, be not gouerned by their like, but by a more excellent nature, to witte, man: ſo mans nature of it ſelfe is too féeble and weake, to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne it ſelfe, vnleſſe it be aſſiſted and guided, by the

                  <hi>Sertorius,</hi> and diuers other, feigned to haue conference with the Gods: that which a good Prince ought to doe, not feignedly or by diſſimulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but by true religion, and certeintie of faith, and hope, in the conduction of God: as Moſes, Dauid, and other like did.</p>
               <p>The royall dignitie comprehending ſummarily in it ſelfe, the authoritie and power of all Magiſtrats at once, is the ſame which is alſo conſecrated with greater and holier ceremonies, as that which appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth néereſt to the diuinitie, and vnto the which, it is the more earneſtly and in particular ſignified to do iuſtice: for there is nothing ſo ſéemely and decent in a Prince, or yet that maketh his life ſo celeſtiall &amp; diuine, as to doe and exerciſe iuſtice: as contrarily, there is nothing that rendereth the ſame ſo beaſtly and brutiſh,<note place="margin">Mars.

And therefore the Emperour <hi>Traiane,</hi> procéeding to the creation of one of his Liuetenants generall, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a ſword into his hande, ſayde right wiſely vnto him: Vſe this ſword in iuſt cauſes: and when I do iniuſtice, draw it againſt my ſelfe.

And in my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, <hi>Charles</hi> the fift king of France of that name,<note place="margin">A moſte iuſt acte done by Charles the fift of France.</note> among other, did one act right worthie of the meting by this great meaſure, and is to be remembred in this place: he had vniuſtly and without deſert, diſcharged and depriued ſundrie perſons of their charges and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, the which he hauing ſoone after eſpied, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced his owne ſentence againſt him ſelfe, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner following: We of our pure and noble office roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, vnto whome it apperteineth to correct, as well our owne doings as others, as oft as we ſée that iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice hath bene thereby wounded and peruerted, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in gréeuing &amp; oppreſſing of the innocent: haue declared the depriuation by vs made, and that which hath inſued, only to haue procéeded of our eſpeciall or abſolute power, and not of right, reaſon, or iuſtice. And vndoubtedly, the true and firme glorie of a king,<note place="margin">The true roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all glorie.</note> is to ſubmit his highneſſe and maieſtie vnto iuſtice: and he can not doe a higher, more royall, and diuine thing, ſurpaſſing common vertues, then to conforme him ſelfe as much as in him lyeth, to God, in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the ſame: conſidering that the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of iuſtice, without compariſon, is far more roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, then to make warre: bycauſe that the making of warre, is an enterpriſe no leſſe common to the good Prince, then to the tyrant, and ſo is not the doing of iuſtice.

Now to make the excellencie, &amp; vtilitie of all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vocations, aboue rehearſed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more cleare, &amp; euident, we muſt next come to the compariſon of ech of them, aſwell of the contemplatiue with the actiue, as of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie of the actiues alſo together one with an other: The caſe ſtanding ſo, that aſwell of the one parte as of the other, there be verie great, and apparant rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, &amp; alſo that oftentimes ſuche compariſons come in queſtion. We will then beginne by the compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the contemplatiue vocation,<note place="margin">The contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>platiue vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on reſteth in the nobleſt parte of man.</note> with the actiue calling: and ſpeaking firſt of the contemplatiue, it is without al doubt, that the ſame lieth in the nobleſt and moſt excellent parte of man, which is the minde: whereby alſo, as by the nobleſt inſtrument of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the higheſt, and greateſt actions, yea, the nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt approching vnto God, be exerciſed. For there is nothing wherein a man may approche ſo nighe, and which is more to conforme himſelf wholy vnto him, then by this contemplatiue, and ſpeculatiue vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: becauſe that the action of this contemplation, is no other thing, but a familiar conuerſation with God, accompanied with the fruition, and continuall inioying of a pure, and firme delight in all tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:11050:52"/> contentation, and accompliſhment of al felicitie.<note place="margin">Contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on conſiſteth chiefly in the vertue of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dome.</note> And becauſe that ſapience is, of all other, the chiefe vertue, as that which reſteth in the knowledge of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine thinges, ſo muche alſo is this contemplatiue vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, (which conſiſteth in this vertue,) more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent then the actiue, which reſteth onely in prudence, and other inferiour, and baſer vertues.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, the higheſt vertue,<note place="margin">The greateſt vertue is that which cauſeth a man to haue leaſte neede of other helpe.</note> and action of man, is that whiche procureth him the leſſe néede of other aide, and meane, and in the whiche, the point of felicitie conſiſteth: whiche is ſéene in the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>platiue vocation, the whiche hauing, as it were, no néede of worldly thinges, is contented, and ſatiſfied in it ſelfe: whereas the actiue vocation ſtandeth but in humane actions, exerciſed by the leſſer, and inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our parte of man, mortall, and tranſitorie, no wayes ſufficient of it ſelfe, but hauing néede of al things tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated: being therewithal in continuall care, toyle, and deſire to atteine the point, and butte of felicitie, (ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe vnperfect,) propoſed in euerie action.

Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teinely to enter into the compariſon of thoſe two vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, ſéemeth that it is to doe neither more nor leſſe, then who ſo woulde make compariſon of the head to the féete, of riuers to the ſea, or elſe of the ſtate, health, and diſpoſition of the whole bodie, to the ſtate, health, and diſpoſition of one member alone.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The publique calling is the band of other priuate voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note>The Publique vocation being a ſure band, &amp; accord of ſundrie thinges, otherwiſe, and without the ſame, diſſioynted, and diſcording together, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expoſed to many daungers, and of ſmall durance. So that it behoueth that the one command, and the other is expreſſely inioyned to obey. And aſmuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance as is betwéene commaunding, and obeying, ſo muche difference ſéemeth to be betwéene the one vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and the other: whiche ſheweth well, that the Publique vocation, is the ſame of all other actiues, vnto the which, without difficultie, the firſt place is due.</p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:11050:55"/>
               <p>But yet for all that,<note place="margin">The priuate vocation.</note> (to come to the Priuate voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) the compariſon of theſe two vocations, is not without controuerſie, ne yet ſo eaſie that a man may well déeme thereof at the firſte ſight. For the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique vocation muſt néedes confeſſe, that without the Priuate vocation, it can doe nothing at all. Becauſe it is moſt certeine,<note place="margin">The priuate vocation mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> that the Priuate calling is the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſpring of all vocations: and of the whiche all be ingendered, aſwell Magiſtrates, Gouernours, and Adminiſtratours of the Publique (as we haue before ſaide) as Prieſtes, Preceptors, Teachers, and Doctoures, and other whatſoeuer: yea, all compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and aſſemblies of men, as Townes, Cities, Prouinces, Realmes, and Empires: So that the Priuate ceaſſing, and failing, of neceſſitie all other ceaſſe alſo. Futher, moſt true it is that the Politique art that is to ſay,<note place="margin">The politique art dependeth of the Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomicall.</note> the arte of well ruling and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a Commonweale, dependeth principally on the Oeconomicall that is to ſay, on the ſcience of well gouerning of a houſholde and familie. Becauſe that it is impoſſible that he ſhould gouerne ſundrie fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, that is not firſt ſkilled in the well ordering and gouerning of one alone: And it cannot be otherwiſe, but that he that is vnable to the one, muſt be alſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the other. And which is more, it is requiſite that euerie gouernement and Publique adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion reſemble, and take his paterne of the Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micall.</p>
               <p>For, where the Kinge, or other ſouereigne Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate ſhall gouerne more to the reſpecte,<note place="margin">The Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micall calling ſerueth for a paterne to the publique.</note> and profite of them he ruleth, then of his owne, then ſhall the ſame be no other but the gouernement of a good Father of a houſholde, towarde his children: or elſe contrarily, if he gouerne with more regarde of his owne particular, then of them whom he commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, then ſhall the ſame alſo be no other, but the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement
<pb facs="tcp:11050:56"/> of a maiſter, toward to his ſeruant. So that the domeſticall gouernement to ſay vprightly, is no<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thing, but an example, and paterne of the Publique, whether we haue regard to commanding or obeying whiche is the principall and chéefe lincke, and bande of Publique gouernement. For in the one and other you ſhall find one ſelfe faſhion of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunding, aſwel in aſking, as in a father of houſholde, and in a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, as in a maiſter: as alſo one ſelfe faſhion of obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that is to ſay, in children, and them that be well ruled, and gouerned, in ſeruantes, and them that be tyrannized: The obedience of the one béeing filiall, and louing: and of the other, ſeruile, and forced.</p>
               <p>And to ſay that the Publique adminiſtration is the health,<note place="margin">
                     <p>The vniuerſal health is the ſoundeneſſe of euery mem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ber.</p>
                     <p>Publique rich<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eſſe, is the wealth of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie.</p>
                  </note> and vniuerſall diſpoſition of all the bodie, in reſpect of the health, and diſpoſition of one member alone, repreſented by the domeſticall gouernement: what is the health, and diſpoſition vniuerſall, but the ſoundneſſe, and diſpoſition of euerie particular mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber? No more then Publique richeſſe, is any other thing, but the wealth, and richeſſe of ſundrie parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſons. So will we alwayes come to this point, that the Publique can not be ought without the Priuate vocation, It booteth not, meaning to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhe the dignitie of Priuate vocation of ſo much, to ſay, that the fame is inioyned to obey, becauſe that commaundement belongeth to the Publique vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: For put caſe it were ſo, it is a leſſe matter, or leſſe apperteining to the gouernement, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of a Common weale, to knowe howe to obey well, then to know how to commaund well? Certeinely the vertue of obeying well,<note place="margin">To knowe howe to obey is no leſſe then to know to commaund</note> is no whit inferiour to the ſame of commaunding well, if it be not greater: For hardly ſhall he commaund well, who hath not firſte learned to obey well: And there ſhall more Common weales be founde decayed, and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:11050:56"/> deſtroyed by want of obedience, then by want of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement. Beſides that this vocation conſiſteth aſmuch in the exerciſe of vertues, ſciences,<note place="margin">The priuate vocation ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſeth the publique in the exerciſe of Artes and Me<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chanicall ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</note> and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall doctrines, as the Publique: but true it is, that it conſiſteth not in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> exerciſe of the Politique, no more then the politique in the exerciſe of the oeconomicall. And the Priuate hath alſo therwithall, more then the Publique, the exerciſe of artes, and Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall ſciences, wherein the nouriture, cloathing, harbouring, and lodging of man conſiſte. And beſide that, the care of his health, and diſpoſition,<note place="margin">The excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the pub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lique vocation in reſpect of the priuate.</note> of his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and paſtimes, with infinit other commodities, no leſſe neceſſarie for mankinde, then one of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, without the whiche mans life cannot dure. And yet for all that, we may not ſay, but that the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique vocation, hath this point, and aduauntage of the priuate:<note place="margin">The ſcope of Publique voca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth in it the drifte and end of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vocations</note> that it ſerueth to mainteine the greateſt and moſt perfect ſocietie, and companie of all, and whiche comprehendeth vnder it ſelfe, all other ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties, and commonalties together. Further, that the ſcope, and drift of the Publique vocation, (whiche is bliſſe, and felicitie,) comprehendeth in it ſelfe all the endes whervnto eche Priuate vocation tendeth ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratly &amp; by it ſelfe. All their drifts ending, and reſting in this ſcope of vocation publique, whiche Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers ſay to be an action, and operation by vertue, wherevnto all Priuate vocations tend, neither more nor leſſe, then all ſpringes, and Riuers doe to the ſea.</p>
               <p>And, albeit that the finall ende of eche one in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular be all one, and like vnto that of a Citie, or Common weale: yet for all that, the ſame of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique is ſo muche the more to be eſtéemed,<note place="margin">The moſte common feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie, is the moſte diuine and perfect.</note> as the bliſſe and felicitie thereof is the more common to many: Of all felicities the ſame being the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte, and néereſt approching to the diuine vertue, whiche is moſt common, and diſperſed among many.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:11050:57"/>
               <p>This Publique vocation hauing beſides that, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together conformitie to the reaſon of Architecture, in reſpect of other actiue vocations, becauſe that it hath authoritie, and eye ouer them all, ordeining to eche one of them what it ought to doe: neither more nor loſſe, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Architectures, or Maiſter workmen ouer all the workemen which be néedefull for the raiſing and conſtruction of a building.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The publike vocation was before the pri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uate.</note>Furthermore, to ſay that the Priuate vocation is the chéefe, &amp; which may ſtande without the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, and not the Publique without the Priuate: is cleane contrarie, if a man conſider more exactly ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. This being moſt certeine that the thing, whiche is whole entier, and perfect, is naturally before the partes thereof. As for example, the Architect mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to builde a houſe, hath ſooner conceiued in his imagination, the whole building that he will make, then euerie parte thereof: So will we ſay of a Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, of that he will paint, and of euerie other worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man going about to vtter his conceite, he beginneth by one part, &amp; endeth by an other, all ſtill for all that remaining vnperfect, vntill the entier perfection, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation, and total accompliſhment of the worke, before wholy conceiued: and the totall béeing once deſtroyed,<note place="margin">Partes be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without the whole.</note> of neceſſitie all the partes thereof muſte come to nothing. And the partes may not be eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>téemed ought, I meane, in vertue, efficacie, &amp; power, in reſpect of the whole, vnleſſe the ſame totall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed in his entier, no more then the foote, or hande of a mans bodie without the coniunction of the whole bodie: So is it of ſeuered houſes, and families, not ioyned, and incorporated to the entier, and perfecte bodie of a Towne, Citie, or Common weale.</p>

               <p>Beſide the caſes before ſpoken of, there is yet an other worthie of noting, which is, that whenſoeuer, &amp; as often as he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is called to any charge, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not exerciſe the ſame as he is bound to do, and without offending of his conſcience.

               <p>And therefore if a King, Prince, or ſuperiour did commaunde any vniuſt, and wicked thing, it were better for a man to abandon his office, and vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">Wiſedome &amp; diſcretion is to be vſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward a prince commanding a wicked thing.</note> then to be in them, a miniſter of iniquitie.

               <p>In reſpect whereof <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaide moſt wiſely, that to take away ought by force,<note place="margin">To do againſt the ſocietie of man, is a thing repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
